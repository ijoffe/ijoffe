# Welcome!

My name is Isaac Joffe and I am currently working towards a Master's of Mathematics in Computer Science (MMath in CS) at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering (BSc in CompE) at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, graduating first in my class.

This GitHub profile is where I show off some of my personal and course-related projects; please take a look.

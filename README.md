# Welcome!

My name is Isaac Joffe and I am currently working towards a Masters of Mathematics in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Prior to this, I earned a BSc in Computer Engineering at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, graduating first in my class.

This GitHub profile is where I exhibit some of my personal projects; please take a look.
